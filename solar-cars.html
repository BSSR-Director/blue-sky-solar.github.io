The design of the vehicle was guided by three requirements: The vehicle must be able to achieve high speeds yet have low power consumption, exhibit great stability at high speeds yet have a low drag value, and have a great safety margin in critical components yet remain lightweight.

As a double-seater vehicle, the team was allowed to double the solar array output to 2300W and the motor power output to 13.4 hp. The team was also capable of keeping the vehicle lightweight by constructing a chassis from carbon board rails, thus minimizing the weight at 500 lbs.

The team fitted Faust II with a composite fiber cloth body which made it extremely durable while also reducing the vehicle's body weight by 40 lbs. Several other improvements were also made to the battery and motor of the vehicle.

Faust was designed as a three-wheeler to minimize rolling resistance and weight. Moreover, the chassis was made of a lightweight hollow tube aluminum space frame which decreased the vehicle's weight to 440 lbs. These design choices made it possible for the vehicle to achieve a top speed of 140 km/h.

With a much greater power output than the Blue Sky Project, Blue II was capable of achieving a top speed of 110 km/h and it was as a key milestone in the technical development of the team. Blue II was completed in 1999 and competed in SunRayce '99.
